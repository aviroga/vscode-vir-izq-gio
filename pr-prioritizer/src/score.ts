/**
 * Scoring engine — pure functions, no I/O.
 *
 * Design rationale:
 *   - All weights live in a single exported `WEIGHTS` constant so they can be
 *     overridden at call sites (e.g. from a config file) and documented in the
 *     academic paper.
 *   - The function returns a per-signal breakdown, not just the total, so the
 *     Markdown report can justify every ranking decision transparently.
 *   - Hard filters (draft, blocked) are applied before scoring; filtered PRs
 *     get a `reason` string instead of a numeric score.

/**
 * Scoring weights.
 * Each entry describes the maximum points a signal can contribute.
 * Total intentionally sums to 100 for easy percentage interpretation.
 *
 * Tuning guidance:
 *   - `age`:     Rewards long-waiting PRs. Capped at 90 days to avoid infinite
 *                inflation for very old stale PRs.
 *   - `size`:    Rewards small PRs — reviewers can turn them around faster.
 *                Capped at 1000 lines; beyond that the penalty is maximum.
 *   - `issue`:   A linked closing issue signals the PR is intentional, scoped,
 *                and tracks community intent.
 *   - `tests`:   Evidence of validation reduces reviewer risk.
 *   - `milestone`: Milestone attachment means the fix is scheduled, increasing
 *                  urgency.
 *   - `labels`:  Any label means the PR has been triaged; small bonus.
